Looking at the bar chart, speculate on why you think some sort algorithms are
faster than others and provide rationale as to your thought process.

  We saw in the last exercise that algorithms that employ recursion are
  especially hard on computer resources and time. In addition, nested loops
  (loops within loops) increase the time complexity as well. I imagine that
  is what we will be learning next.

  Heap Sort is a great example of a time complex algorithm, where every sort
  requires a multitude of adjustments (heapify).
